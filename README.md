## **Description:**

- Our project is inspired by our love for music. Music has been widely used as a method for altering one‚Äôs emotional state. Using the Spotify Web API, our team decided to create an app which could help us with our project. Whether one feels like working out at the gym or just relaxing on your couch, music can enhance that experience with ease and bring us closer to that state of mind.
  However, the user can also choose to search and play any track available depending on their own taste.
